# Netflix_Data_Analysis_Using_Python

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix viewing patterns and user behavior using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from Netflix's dataset to understand content popularity, user preferences, and trends over time. 

The project involves Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Visualizations to help answer key business questions, such as:
1. Which content genres are most popular across different regions?
2. How has Netflix's content library evolved over time?
3. What are the viewing habits of users, and how can they inform content recommendations?

Key Features:
1. Data Wrangling & Cleaning: Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
3. Visualizations: Building informative and interactive visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to effectively communicate insights.
4. Content Popularity Analysis: Investigating the most watched genres, shows, and movies based on region and release year.
5. Time-Series Analysis: Analyzing how Netflix's catalog and user engagement have changed over time.

Tools & Libraries:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy)
2. Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
3. Jupyter Notebook (for code and analysis)
   
How to Use:
1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/RITU0799/Netflix_Data_Analysis_Using_Python.git
2. Install the Required Libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to follow along with the Analysis.

Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into Netflix's vast dataset, helping to understand user preferences and content trends. The findings can be applied to improve content recommendations and develop data-driven strategies.
